# Messagin'
Simulate natural language conversation with message variation.

Messagin' allows you to quickly create chat-based interfaces that don't feel scripted. Through use of a simple but powerful XML-based markup language, you can easily create multiple variations of a single message, adjust their probability, and insert variables.

## Installing
Install from PyPI:
```sh
sudo pip3 install messagin
```
Alternatively, clone this repository and run:
```sh
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
